The project's aim is to improve preoperative experiences for forehead flap for nasal reconstruction patients, resulting in better postoperative outcomes.
By allowing these patients to visualize their perioperative facial outcomes in an immersive, personalized, realistic VR environment, the application aims to lower patient's preoperative anxiety, improve patient education, prepare patients for the surgical procedure, better manage patient expectations, and promote shared-decision making between patients and surgeons.
